%d    : prints decimal integer
%6d   : prints as decimal integer, at least 6 characters wide 
%f    : print as floating point 
%6f   : print as floating point, at least 6 characters wide 
%.2f  : print as floating point, 2 characters after decimal point 
%6.2f : print as floating point, at least 6 wide and 2 after decimal 

Takeaway: 
- d stands for decimal, f stands for float
- first number before the decimal point stands for total characters 
- number after decimal point stands for how many numbers after decimal 

%s : used as a string shortcut in strings for a variable

char[] myName = "Jordyn";
int myAge = 18;
printf("Hello my name is %s and I am %d years old, myName, myAge);
